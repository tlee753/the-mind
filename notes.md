### Timing
`maxConnections = 100`
| # Neurons | Build Time | Connections |
| --------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| 400       | 1 sec      | 18          |
| 800       | 2 sec      | 42          |
| 4000      | 13 sec     | 73          |
| 8000      | 64/2 sec   | 69          |
| 16000     | 117/2 sec  | 88          |
| 32000     | 406/2 sec  | 100         |

86,000,000,000/2 Neurons = 628,875,000/2 seconds = 7279/2 days = 20/2 years

### Ideation
- try manhattan distance for speed boost?
- nature of linguistics tailored toward a societal approximation of intelligence
    - social structure in developing computer networks
        - difficult without evolutionary pressure
    - human teacher
-  proximity assignment of neurons for speed boost?
